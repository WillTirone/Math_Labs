# Math Labs
A repository for labs using MATLAB from Differential Equations and Linear Algebra. Because GitHub has difficult rendering .mlx files, which display inline output similar to a Jupyter Notebook, I uploaded the .mlx and .m files used in the lab, as well as a PDF result that is more easily viewable on GitHub. 

## Linear Algebra - MAT 343 
1. [LAB 1](https://github.com/WillTirone/Math_Labs_and_Notes/blob/master/Lin_Alg_MAT343/lab%201/Lab%201%20Will%20Tirone.pdf) - An introduction to MATLAB and performing some basic matrix manipulation and calculations.
