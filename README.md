# Math Labs
A repository for labs using MATLAB from Differential Equations and Linear Algebra. Because GitHub has difficult rendering .mlx files, which display inline output similar to a Jupyter Notebook, I have linked directly to the PDF output below. If you're interested in the .m or .mlx files used to generate the output, they are also included in the respective folders. 

## Linear Algebra - MAT 343 
[LAB 1: ](https://github.com/WillTirone/Math_Labs_and_Notes/blob/master/Lin_Alg_MAT343/lab%201/Lab%201%20Will%20Tirone.pdf) - An introduction to MATLAB and performing some basic matrix manipulation and calculations. 

[LAB 2: ](https://github.com/WillTirone/Math_Labs_and_Notes/blob/master/Lin_Alg_MAT343/lab2/TIRONE_MAT343_LAB2.pdf) - Exploring how MATLAB solves equations with matrices, particularly **Ax=b** by comparing solutions using left division or the inverse of the matrix. 

[LAB 4: ](https://github.com/WillTirone/Math_Labs_and_Notes/blob/master/Lin_Alg_MAT343/lab4/LAB_4_TIRONE.pdf) - Looking at rotation, reflection, and shearing matrices along with their plots. 

[LAB 5: ](https://github.com/WillTirone/Math_Labs_and_Notes/blob/master/Lin_Alg_MAT343/lab5/WILLIAM_TIRONE_LAB_5.pdf) - This lab involved fitting linear, quadratic, and a 5th order polynomial to some data points using matrices and the solutions to the normal equations. 

[Lab 6: ](https://github.com/WillTirone/Math_Labs_and_Notes/blob/master/Lin_Alg_MAT343/lab%206/WILL_TIRONE_LAB_6.pdf) - Using different rank-k approximations to compress an image to reduce the size and observe the effects of the data reduction. 

## Differential Equations - MAT 275
[LAB 1: ](https://github.com/WillTirone/Math_Labs_and_Notes/blob/master/Diff_Eq_MAT275/LAB%201/WILL_TIRONE_LAB1.pdf) - A basic lab to plot some equations and solutions to those differential equations. 

[LAB 2: ](https://github.com/WillTirone/Math_Labs_and_Notes/blob/master/Diff_Eq_MAT275/LAB%202/WILL_TIRONE_LAB_2.pdf) - A brief look at for loops in MATLAB as well as working with .m files. 

[LAB 3: ](https://github.com/WillTirone/Math_Labs_and_Notes/blob/master/Diff_Eq_MAT275/LAB%203/WILL_TIRONE_LAB_3.pdf) - Comparing Euler's method, and the improved Euler's method, to the analytical solution of some differential equations by calculating the approximation and plotting both solutions on the slope field of the equation. 

[LAB 4: ](https://github.com/WillTirone/Math_Labs_and_Notes/blob/master/Diff_Eq_MAT275/LAB%204/WILL_TIRONE_LAB_4.pdf) - Solving IVPs using ODE45, then examining the phase plot and whether or not these problems reached any kind of long-term equilibrium. 

[LAB 5: ](https://github.com/WillTirone/Math_Labs_and_Notes/blob/master/Diff_Eq_MAT275/LAB%205/LAB_5_WILL_TIRONE.pdf) - In an under-damped, overdamped, or ciritically damped mass-spring system, examining the amplitude, period of motion, whether or not it will come to rest, velocity, and frequency. Also solved some of the equations analytically and compared these to the approximate solutions by plotting.
