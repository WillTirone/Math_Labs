Differential Equations

From the syllabus: 

At the completion of this course, students will be able to:
Solve First-Order Equations that are Linear, and that are Separable;
Investigate conditions for the Existence of a Unique solution;
Solve autonomous Equations and the Stability of the equilibrium solutions;
Model Mixture Problems, Population Growth, Motion, Newtonâ€™s Law of cooling;
Numerically solve first order Initial Value Problems;
Solve Second-Order Equations that are Linear, Homogeneous, and with Constant Coefficients;
Solve Nonhomogeneous Equations using the Method of Undetermined Coefficients;
Study the Mechanical Vibrations of a mass-spring system both in the absence of an external for and in the presence of an external force;
Use Laplace Transform to solve differential equations
Use Linear Algebra, in particular the Eigenvalue Problem to solve Systems of first order equations with constant coefficients;
Use MATLAB to solve all the above.
